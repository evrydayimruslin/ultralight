# Ultralight Spec

Ultralight is a serverless MCP app platform. Developers write functions in TypeScript, deploy them, and Ultralight handles execution, data storage (Cloudflare D1/SQLite), user authentication, billing, and metering.

## What this directory is

This `ultralight-spec/` directory contains the canonical conventions for building Ultralight apps. It is the single source of truth for both human developers and coding agents.

## How to use this spec

**Agents**: Read everything in `conventions/` before generating any code. Follow every rule — the platform enforces most of them at runtime and deploy time.

**Humans**: Reference `conventions/` when designing schemas, writing migrations, or building new app functions.
