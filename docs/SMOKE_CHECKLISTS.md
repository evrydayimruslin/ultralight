# Smoke Checklists

These are the short smoke checks for staging and production after the Wave 0 /
Wave 1 launch hardening work.

The recommended operator entry point is now:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/smoke/run-release-smoke.mjs --help
```

That wrapper runs the command-line smoke checks below and writes machine-readable
and markdown summaries into the Wave 6 evidence layout. The manual desktop
checks in this document still remain manual on purpose.

## Pre-Smoke Guardrails

Before running manual smoke on a release candidate, confirm the automated
Wave 1 guardrails are clean locally or in CI:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/checks/run-guardrail-checks.mjs
```

This should match the committed baseline. A changed result means a new
tokenized-URL, wildcard-CORS, placeholder-runtime, or backup-artifact finding
needs review before release smoke continues.

## Staging Smoke (after push to `main`)

Recommended wrapper:

```bash
export UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR="docs/_generated/launch/staging/2026-04-21-main-<sha>"
mkdir -p "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR"/{audits,smoke,manual}

source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... node scripts/smoke/run-release-smoke.mjs \
  --target staging \
  --url https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev \
  --supabase-url https://uavjzycsltdnwblwutmb.supabase.co \
  --exercise-chat
```

This writes:

- `smoke/guardrails.txt`
- `smoke/auth-redirect.log`
- `smoke/api-smoke.log`
- `smoke/cors-allowed.*`
- `smoke/cors-blocked.*`
- `smoke/summary.json`
- `smoke/summary.md`

After the wrapper finishes, copy the result paths and final pass/fail state
into `release-packet.md` for the candidate.

### Automated checks

Run the auth redirect smoke once the staging Worker origin is live:

```bash
./scripts/smoke/auth-redirect-smoke.sh \
  --url https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev \
  --supabase-url https://uavjzycsltdnwblwutmb.supabase.co
```

Run the durable-execution smoke (async dispatch → queue consumer → job
poll). One green pass proves the EXEC_QUEUE producer, the `queue()` consumer
(including `ctx.exports`/`LOADER` availability inside it — undocumented
platform behavior we rely on), the queued→running claim, the loaded-isolate
resource limits, and settlement:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/durable-exec-smoke.mjs \
  --url https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev \
  --token "$ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN" \
  --app <agent-id-or-slug> --function <functionName> \
  --args '{}'
```

Exit 0 = full pass; exit 2 = spine worked but the function itself failed
(verify that is expected for the chosen function).

Manual durable-execution + interop checks (record outcomes in the release
packet):

- [ ] Event bus on Queues: wire two agents (subscribe grant on a topic),
      `ultralight.emit` from the emitter, confirm the delivery lands in
      seconds (not on the minute tick) and the delivery row records the
      receipt. A failed handler must surface as a `failed` delivery + event.
- [ ] SELF loopbacks: a `ul.call` between two agents and one routine
      execution succeed on the deployed worker (no error 1042 / public-URL
      fetch in the logs).
- [ ] Stripe test-mode topup: card flow from launch-web → webhook →
      balance credited; the topup checkbox links to /terms.
- [ ] Session refresh: leave a launch-web tab open >1h (or expire the
      access token manually) and confirm a silent refresh, not a logout.
- [ ] Tenant limits sanity: one normal app run and one codemode run succeed
      (limits not tripping legitimate work); optionally a busy-loop test app
      to confirm the cpuMs kill surfaces as an execution failure.

Run the broader API smoke with a staging bearer token:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... ./scripts/smoke-test.sh \
  --url https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev \
  --exercise-chat
```

For chat capture rollout candidates, run the capture-specific smoke after the
staging migration has been pushed and the staging Worker has
`ANALYTICS_PEPPER_V1` plus `CHAT_CAPTURE_ENABLED=true` configured:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... \
node scripts/smoke/chat-capture-smoke.mjs \
  --target staging \
  --exercise-orchestrate \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/smoke/chat-capture.json"
```

This sends one real `/chat/orchestrate` request with project context and a small
file attachment, then verifies `chat_threads`, `chat_messages`, `chat_events`,
`capture_artifacts`, and `capture_artifact_links` rows appeared for the smoke
conversation.

Run a quick CORS sanity check from one allowed and one disallowed origin:

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev/http/test/ping \
  -H 'Origin: https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'

curl -i -X OPTIONS https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev/http/test/ping \
  -H 'Origin: https://evil.example' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'
```

Run the launch website Pages smoke after `Launch Web Deploy` succeeds:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... \
node scripts/smoke/launch-web-pages-smoke.mjs \
  --target staging \
  --pages-url https://staging.ultralight-launch-web.pages.dev \
  --api-url https://ultralight-api-staging.rgn4jz429m.workers.dev \
  --tool-slug <known-public-tool-slug> \
  --admin-tool-id <owned-staging-tool-id> \
  --output-dir "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR"
```

This writes `smoke/launch-web-pages.json` and
`smoke/launch-web-pages.md`. It verifies:

- public Pages routes: `/`, `/install`, `/store`, `/tools/:slug`
- authenticated SPA routes: `/library`, `/wallet`, `/settings`,
  `/admin/tools/:id`
- launch API from the Pages origin: `/api/launch/status`,
  `/api/launch/openapi.json`, `/api/launch/store?limit=1`
- CORS preflight for the staging Pages origin
- authenticated launch API probes for library, wallet, settings/API keys, and
  optionally admin tool details when a real owned tool id is supplied

Use a real staging token for `ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN`; if omitted, authenticated API
probes are marked `skipped` and should not be counted as full launch-web
signoff.

Notes:

- `--exercise-chat` sends one tiny streaming prompt and incurs a small real API
  cost.
- Use a real staging test account with enough balance to pass
  `/debug/chat-preflight`.
- If alias retirement is being trialed with
  `PLATFORM_MCP_DISABLED_ALIASES=removable`, include one manual MCP call using a
  removable alias such as `ul.execute` or `ul.lint` and confirm the response
  points at the canonical replacement instead of silently succeeding.

### Manual desktop checks

Use the latest desktop artifact from the `Desktop Build` workflow on `main`.

1. Launch the staging desktop build.
2. Click `Sign in with Google` and confirm the system browser opens.
3. Complete Google sign-in with a staging test user.
4. Confirm the desktop leaves the auth gate without manual token entry.
5. Send one short prompt in a fresh chat and confirm the response streams.
6. Click `Sign out` and confirm the desktop returns to the auth screen.
7. Click `Use another account` and confirm the browser shows Google account
   selection instead of silently reusing the previous account.
8. If you cancel mid-poll, confirm `Open sign-in page again` reopens the login
   page cleanly.
9. Open an embedded settings/dashboard page and confirm the loaded URL uses
   `#bridge_token=...` when auth handoff is needed, not `?token=...`.
10. Open a shared markdown page link and confirm it lands on
    `/share/p/...#share_token=...`, then redirects to `/p/...` without leaving
    the share secret in the request URL.

Stop-ship failures:

- Browser login never reaches the desktop app
- Desktop poll never completes after successful browser auth
- First chat cannot stream
- Sign out leaves the desktop in a broken authenticated state
- Any copied MCP/dashboard/share URL exposes a bearer-style `?token=...`
- Shared markdown links fail after the fragment bootstrap redirect
- Allowed/disallowed CORS preflight behavior does not match the environment
- Staging launch-web deep links fail to return the SPA shell
- Staging launch-web cannot call the staging API because CORS rejects its origin
- Staging launch-web smoke reports `pages-routing`, `pages-spa-shell`,
  `api-status`, `api-openapi`, `api-data`, `api-cors`, `auth-api`, or
  `auth-data` failures without an accepted release-packet exception
- The release packet still shows `pending` for smoke after the candidate smoke
  is complete

## Production Smoke (after pushing a release tag)

Recommended wrapper:

```bash
export UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR="docs/_generated/launch/production/2026-04-21-v0.1.0-<sha>"
mkdir -p "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR"/{audits,smoke,manual}

source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... node scripts/smoke/run-release-smoke.mjs \
  --target production \
  --url https://api.ultralightagent.com \
  --supabase-url https://uavjzycsltdnwblwutmb.supabase.co \
  --exercise-chat
```

### Automated checks

Run the auth redirect smoke:

```bash
./scripts/smoke/auth-redirect-smoke.sh \
  --url https://api.ultralightagent.com \
  --supabase-url https://uavjzycsltdnwblwutmb.supabase.co
```

Run the broader API smoke with a production bearer token:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... ./scripts/smoke-test.sh \
  --url https://api.ultralightagent.com \
  --exercise-chat
```

For chat capture rollout candidates, run the capture-specific smoke after the
production migration has been pushed and the production Worker has
`ANALYTICS_PEPPER_V1` plus `CHAT_CAPTURE_ENABLED=true` configured:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... \
node scripts/smoke/chat-capture-smoke.mjs \
  --target production \
  --exercise-orchestrate \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/smoke/chat-capture.json"
```

If a future owned public production domain drifts away from the Worker
deployment, pass it explicitly with `--url` and compare it against the
Workers.dev origin before promoting it as canonical.

Run the same CORS sanity check against production before announcing the release:

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS https://api.ultralightagent.com/http/test/ping \
  -H 'Origin: https://api.ultralightagent.com' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'

curl -i -X OPTIONS https://api.ultralightagent.com/http/test/ping \
  -H 'Origin: https://evil.example' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'
```

Run the launch website Pages smoke after `Launch Web Deploy` succeeds:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... \
node scripts/smoke/launch-web-pages-smoke.mjs \
  --target production \
  --pages-url https://ultralightagent.com \
  --api-url https://api.ultralightagent.com \
  --tool-slug <known-public-tool-slug> \
  --admin-tool-id <owned-production-tool-id> \
  --output-dir "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR"
```

This writes `smoke/launch-web-pages.json` and
`smoke/launch-web-pages.md`. The Pages route probes should return the launch
SPA shell, the API probes should return the expected launch JSON shapes, and
the CORS probes should show
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://ultralightagent.com`.

### Manual desktop checks

Use the freshly published installer from the GitHub Release.

1. Install or update to the tagged desktop build.
2. Launch the app and complete Google sign-in.
3. Send one short prompt in a new chat and confirm the response streams.
4. Start a new session and confirm the app still behaves normally.
5. Sign out and confirm the auth screen returns.
6. Optionally verify `Use another account` if auth-session behavior changed in
   the release.
7. Confirm any copied MCP/API URL is a bare URL without `?token=...`.
8. Confirm a newly generated shared markdown link uses
   `/share/p/...#share_token=...` and still opens successfully after the
   bootstrap redirect.
9. Open the production launch website wallet and public tool routes and confirm
   they load against the production API, not staging.
10. If alias retirement shipped in this release, run one manual removable-alias
   probe and confirm the API returns a clear canonical replacement error.

### Optional updater smoke

Run this only when you have a previously tagged production build installed.

1. Install the previous signed desktop release.
2. Publish the new signed tag and wait for `latest.json` to land on the GitHub
   Release.
3. Relaunch the installed desktop app and wait for the update toast to appear.
4. Confirm the toast names the new version and offers `Update & relaunch`.
5. Click the update action and confirm the app restarts into the newer version.

After production smoke, update `release-packet.md` with:

- the `Production Launch Gate` URL
- the production smoke summary result
- the production launch-web Pages smoke result
- the manual desktop and updater outcomes
- any accepted launch exceptions that still apply to the candidate

## Scope Notes

- These smoke checks are intentionally short. They exist to catch launch-killer
  auth, routing, and first-chat failures quickly.
- The wrapper script only automates the command-line portion of release smoke.
  Manual desktop verification still needs to be recorded separately in the
  evidence directory.
- The current desktop auth smoke is split between a scriptable backend redirect
  check and a short manual desktop UI pass. Full desktop E2E automation is a
  later improvement, not a launch requirement.
- Signing out revokes the current server-side refresh/session path, but a raw
  access-token JWT that was copied elsewhere can still remain valid until its
  natural expiry.
