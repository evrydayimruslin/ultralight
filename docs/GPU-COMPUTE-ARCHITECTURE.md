# GPU Compute Runtime — Full Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Context

Ultralight is a marketplace where developers deploy functions as callable MCP tools. Currently CPU-only via Deno sandbox. We're adding GPU compute as a parallel runtime so developers can publish GPU-native functions (3D rendering, physics simulations, video processing, scientific computing, cryptographic proofs) alongside existing Deno functions. The marketplace mechanics (discovery, micropayments, escrow acquisition) are compute-agnostic and require minimal changes.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Philosophy

- **GPU compute as capability primitive, not infrastructure primitive.** Developers think about functions, not instances. They manage logic, not scaling. They set a price, not build billing.
- **GPU functions are broader than AI.** Primary use cases: 3D rendering, physics simulations, video processing, scientific computing, cryptographic proofs. AI inference on standard models handled by existing `ultralight.ai()` with OpenRouter/BYOK.
- **The marketplace creates a spot market for GPU-native IP.** Per-call revenue while you hold a function, clean sale via escrow when someone wants to own it outright.

### Provider Strategy

- **MVP:** RunPod Serverless. Per-second billing (rounded up), 10-13x markup. Zero idle cost.
- **Growth:** RunPod Active Workers (reserved, 20-30% discount) for high-traffic functions.
- **Scale:** Colocation only at 50+ GPUs, >80% utilization (Series B+ decision).
- **Provider abstraction interface** for future multi-provider support.

### Rate Table (All-in Per-ms, 10-13x Markup)

| GPU | VRAM | RunPod Cost/ms | Platform Rate/ms | Markup |
|-----|------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| A40 | 48GB | $0.0000001 | $0.000001 | ~10x |
| L40 / RTX 6000 Ada | 48GB | $0.0000002 | $0.000002 | ~10x |
| L40S | 48GB | $0.00000022 | $0.0000022 | ~10x |
| A100 PCIe | 80GB | $0.00000033 | $0.000004 | ~12x |
| A100 SXM | 80GB | $0.00000039 | $0.000005 | ~13x |
| H100 PCIe | 80GB | $0.00000055 | $0.000007 | ~13x |
| H100 SXM | 80GB | $0.00000075 | $0.000009 | ~12x |
| H100 NVL | 94GB | $0.00000072 | $0.000009 | ~12x |
| H200 | 141GB | $0.0000010 | $0.000012 | ~12x |
| B200 | 180GB | $0.0000017 | $0.000020 | ~12x |

### Upload & Packaging

- Small code packages within existing file size limits (50MB upload, 10MB per file, 100MB storage quota).
- Developer uploads: `main.py` + `requirements.txt` + `ultralight.gpu.yaml` + `test_fixture.json`.
- No weight hosting. Pure code. AI model weights stored externally by developer if needed (minority case).

### Config File

```yaml
runtime: gpu
gpu_type: A100-80GB-SXM
python: "3.11"
max_duration_ms: 2000
```

### GPU Selection

- Explicit via `gpu_type` (Option B with guardrails).
- Platform suggests cheaper GPU if benchmark shows VRAM over-provisioning.

### Container Building

- Base image layer caching: pre-built `python+cuda+torch` images. Developer code layered on top.
- Build time ~45s for common case.
- Container harness (Python wrapper) injected at build time for structured error reporting.

### Async Benchmark

- Upload returns immediately with `gpu_status: 'building'`.
- Background job builds container, runs benchmark (5 runs), computes mean/stddev/variance.
- Function goes live when benchmark passes.
- State machine: `building -> benchmarking -> live | build_failed | benchmark_failed`
- Regression detection on version update: adaptive threshold `max(20%, variance_pct * 1.5)`.
- Developer can acknowledge regression and publish anyway.

### max_duration_ms Suggestion

- Formula: `max(benchmark_p95 * 2.0, benchmark_median * 3.0, 1000)`
- Three options: Conservative (1.4x), Recommended (2x), Generous (4x).

### Developer Pricing (Three Primitives)

1. **Per-call flat fee:** Developer sets price, caller knows cost upfront. Self-metering (platform measures).
2. **Per-unit pricing:** Developer sets price per unit, platform counts units via `unit_count_from` JSONPath on input payload.
3. **Per-duration (pass-through):** Caller pays proportional to actual GPU-ms. Requires `max_duration_ms` ceiling.

### Billing & Settlement

- Caller pays: GPU compute cost + developer fee = total.
- Developer earns: developer fee x 0.90 (10% platform fee).
- Platform earns: developer fee x 0.10 + GPU compute margin.
- Balance locked before execution (estimated max cost). Settled to actual after execution.
- Cold starts absorbed by platform. Egress absorbed for MVP.

### Failure Policy

**Chargeable** (real GPU resources consumed):
- OOM, unhandled exception, timeout
- Charge actual compute cost. Refund developer fee.

**Non-chargeable** (platform responsibility):
- Container failed to start, network error, validation error
- Full refund.

**Partial results** (batch processing):
- Return completed units, charge proportionally.

### Concurrency Limits

- Per-function, enforced at gateway.
- Over limit: 5s queue -> 429 with `Retry-After` + `X-Queue-Position` + `X-Estimated-Wait-Ms`.

| Tier | Default | Max Configurable |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Pro | 5 | 20 |
| Scale | 20 | 100 |
| Enterprise | 50 | 500 |

### Warm Pool Strategy

- **Phase 1 (launch):** Pure serverless. Zero idle cost.
- **Phase 2 (data-driven):** Active Workers for functions with >100 calls/hour.
- **Phase 3 (scale):** Reserved capacity for predictable baseline load.
- Always platform-funded, never developer-funded.

### Marketplace Integration

- Existing escrow/sale mechanics are compute-agnostic.
- Transparent listing: developer fee + estimated compute + reliability indicator.
- `weights_included` attribute for acquisitions.
- Reliability: rolling 7-day, green >=99%, yellow >=95%, red <95%.

## Execution Flow

```
1. Agent calls GPU function via MCP/HTTP
2. Gateway: auth + balance check + lock estimated cost
3. Concurrency check: under limit -> proceed; over -> 5s queue -> 429
4. Scheduler: warm container -> route; cold -> RunPod Serverless (3-8s)
5. Execution: isolated GPU container with harness
6. Settlement: actual cost deducted, developer credited, excess released
```
