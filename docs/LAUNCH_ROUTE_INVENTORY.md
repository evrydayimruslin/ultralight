# Launch Route Inventory

Last reviewed: `2026-04-21`

This document is the Wave 0 route and surface inventory for launch hardening.
It is intentionally derived from the live dispatch points in:

- `api/handlers/app.ts`
- `api/handlers/auth.ts`
- `api/handlers/user.ts`
- `api/handlers/apps.ts`
- `api/handlers/discover.ts`
- `api/handlers/oauth.ts`
- `api/handlers/developer.ts`
- `api/handlers/admin.ts`
- `api/handlers/chat.ts`
- `api/handlers/http.ts`
- `api/handlers/mcp.ts`
- `api/handlers/platform-mcp.ts`
- `api/handlers/tier.ts`
- `api/handlers/upload.ts`
- `worker/src/index.ts`
- `desktop/src/components/WebPanel.tsx`
- `web/layout.ts`

## How To Read This

- `Validation`
  - `Strong`: explicit signature checks, typed/manual field validation, and
    ownership or state checks are all present.
  - `Partial`: some manual validation exists, but the route is not schema-first
    or leaves important inputs implicit.
  - `Weak`: little or no route-level validation beyond parsing.
  - `N/A`: static shell or non-mutating HTML page.
- `RL`
  - `Yes`: explicit rate limiting was found on the route.
  - `Partial`: rate limiting exists only for some methods, some callers, or via
    app-configured limits.
  - `No`: no explicit rate limit found in the route path.
- `Risk`
  - `P0`: auth/session/token transport, CORS, billing, secrets, payouts, or
    permissions exposure.
  - `P1`: state-changing platform routes, publish surfaces, internal service
    routes, and high-impact write paths.
  - `P2`: authenticated read paths or bounded user settings/configuration.
  - `P3`: static or low-risk public read surfaces.

## Owner Map

Where the repo does not identify an individual owner, this inventory uses
subsystem owners:

- `Auth & Identity`
- `Apps & Runtime`
- `Discovery & Growth`
- `Billing & Marketplace`
- `Developer Platform`
- `AI Runtime`
- `Desktop & Web Shell`
- `Internal Platform Ops`
- `Data Worker`

## Coverage Notes

- The canonical main API runtime is now the Cloudflare Worker entrypoint in
  `api/src/worker-entry.ts`, deployed through `api/wrangler.toml` and
  `.github/workflows/api-deploy.yml`. The former `api/main.ts` + `Dockerfile`
  + `.do/app.yaml` path has been moved under `archive/legacy-runtime/` and
  should not be treated as the current release path.
- `worker/src/index.ts` remains inventoried because it is still a distinct
  internal service surface behind `WORKER_DATA_URL` / `WORKER_SECRET`, even
  though it is not the main API runtime.
- `/u/:slug` is currently handled early by the layout shell route in
  `api/handlers/app.ts`. A later `handlePublicUserProfile()` path exists in the
  same file but appears shadowed and not externally reachable in practice.
- Request-URL token transport has now been removed from desktop embeds,
  `/http/:appId/*`, `/mcp/:appId`, public shells, and shared-page links.
  Shared pages now use `/share/p/:userId/:slug#share_token=...` plus
  `POST /auth/page-share/exchange` to mint a page-scoped HttpOnly cookie
  before redirecting to `/p/:userId/:slug`.
- CORS behavior is now centralized in `api/services/cors.ts`, with zero
  `wildcard-cors` guardrail findings in the reviewed baseline.
- Rate limiting now covers discover, chat, MCP, platform MCP, auth/OAuth,
  embed/share bootstrap, provisional signup, token/BYOK/Supabase mutations,
  developer app mutations, MCP config generation, app env/settings/
  Supabase-assignment mutations, billing/connect writes, marketplace writes,
  upload creation/draft, and admin mutations. Remaining gaps are now mostly
  low-priority debug/operator exceptions.

## Desktop And Embed Surfaces

These are not standalone server routes, but they are externally reachable
launch surfaces because they shape how the desktop app authenticates and embeds
web content.

| Surface | Caller class | Auth model | Validation | RL | State touched | Owner | Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop/src/components/WebPanel.tsx` iframe embed | Desktop app | Short-lived bridge token in fragment, exchanged into cookie session | N/A | No | Browser session bridge | Desktop & Web Shell | P1 | No longer emits long-lived user/API tokens into iframe URLs |
| `web/layout.ts` embed mode | Embedded browser shell | Reads `embed=1`, exchanges `#bridge_token`, and strips stale auth URL artifacts | N/A | No | Browser session bootstrap | Desktop & Web Shell | P1 | Bridge-token bootstrap is active and the old localStorage/query migration readers are removed |
| App endpoint copy flows in `web/layout.ts` | Browser user | Bare MCP URL copy plus separate API key/header usage | N/A | No | Direct app invocation | Desktop & Web Shell | P1 | User-facing app endpoint copy no longer leaks bearer tokens into generated URLs |

## Route Inventory Findings To Carry Into Wave 1

- `P1`: desktop embed generation, MCP/HTTP bearer-query transport, old
  web-shell/generic-dashboard query/hash bootstrap readers, and shared-page
  request-URL token transport are now removed in code. Shared pages now use a
  fragment bootstrap route plus a page-scoped HttpOnly cookie, and the reviewed
  `query-token-auth` guardrail count is now `0`.
- `P1`: CORS allowlist code now exists, but staging/production still need
  deploy verification and smoke coverage.
- `P1`: logout now revokes the current server-side refresh/session path, but
  access-token JWTs still remain valid until expiry.
- `P1`: rate limiting now covers auth/OAuth bootstrap, discovery/chat, MCP,
  platform MCP, app HTTP, provisional signup, token/BYOK/Supabase writes,
  developer mutations, MCP config generation, app env/settings/Supabase
  writes, billing and Stripe Connect mutations, marketplace money-moving
  writes, uploads, and admin write paths. Remaining gaps are mostly lower-risk
  debug/operator surfaces and whatever future sensitive routes land without the
  shared helper.
- `P1`: there are still debug and temporary routes in the live tree
  (`/api/imap-test`, `/debug/*`, `/debug/add-credits`) that should be either
  gated harder, removed, or explicitly classed as non-production.
