# Release Runbook

This is the operator playbook for staging validation and public desktop
releases after the Wave 0 / Wave 1 launch-hardening work.

## Preconditions

Before running this flow, make sure:

- staging and production Supabase projects are configured
- `staging-api.ultralight.dev` and `api.ultralight.dev` both point at the right
  Worker deployments
- GitHub environment secrets are configured for:
  - staging database deploy
  - production database deploy
  - staging API deploy
  - production API deploy
  - desktop macOS signing / notarization
  - desktop Windows signing
  - Tauri updater signing + public key

Start with
[docs/RELEASE_TOPOLOGY.md](RELEASE_TOPOLOGY.md)
if you need to answer “what deploys where, and in what order?” This runbook is
the operational procedure layered on top of that topology.

Before collecting audit or smoke output, define a local evidence directory that
matches the conventions in
[docs/LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_REGISTRY.md](LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_REGISTRY.md).

Example staging candidate:

```bash
export UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR="docs/_generated/launch/staging/2026-04-21-main-<sha>"
mkdir -p "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR"/{audits,smoke,manual}
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/ops/init-release-packet.mjs \
  --target staging \
  --commit-sha <sha> \
  --git-ref main
```

## Runtime Architecture

The canonical launch runtime is:

- main API: Cloudflare Worker from
  [api/src/worker-entry.ts](../api/src/worker-entry.ts)
- deployment path: Wrangler plus
  [.github/workflows/api-deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/api-deploy.yml)
- schema path: [supabase/migrations/](../supabase/migrations)

Important scope note:

- [worker/src/index.ts](../worker/src/index.ts)
  is currently a secondary internal data-layer worker, not the main API
  entrypoint.
- the former DO/Deno deployment files now live under
  [archive/legacy-runtime/](../archive/legacy-runtime)
  and are historical reference only, not part of the standard release flow.
- the full cross-surface promotion chain now lives in
  [docs/RELEASE_TOPOLOGY.md](RELEASE_TOPOLOGY.md),
  including the current staging/production shared-resource exceptions.
- the detailed owner/risk/removal map for those exceptions now lives in
  [docs/ENVIRONMENT_ISOLATION_MATRIX.md](ENVIRONMENT_ISOLATION_MATRIX.md)
  and should be reviewed whenever a candidate touches Cloudflare bindings,
  `worker/**`, or desktop runtime environment wiring.

## Supabase Migration Audit

Before rolling out the Wave 4 Supabase cleanup, generate a real migration
report from the target environment:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/supabase/audit-app-supabase-configs.mjs \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/supabase-audit.json"
```

That report identifies which apps already use saved config IDs and which still
need migration from legacy app-level or platform-default Supabase state.

## Manifest Contract Audit

Before rolling out the Wave 4 manifest-first cleanup, generate a real contract
coverage report from the target environment:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/apps/audit-app-manifest-coverage.mjs \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/manifest-coverage-audit.json"
```

That report identifies which stored apps are already manifest-backed and which
still rely on legacy `skills_parsed`, GPU export discovery, or plain export
fallback.

## API Token Compatibility Audit

Before rolling out the Wave 4 token-schema cleanup, generate a real token
compatibility report from the target environment:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/tokens/audit-api-token-compat.mjs \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/token-compat-audit.json"
```

If the report shows legacy rows that still retain plaintext, you can backfill
canonical salts and hashes in-place:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/tokens/audit-api-token-compat.mjs \
  --apply-backfill \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/token-compat-audit.json"
```

Rows reported as `legacy_unrecoverable` should be revoked or deleted before
closing Wave 4 token cleanup, because they will no longer validate once the
remaining plaintext-assisted migration branch is removed.

## Chat Capture Rollout

Before enabling chat capture on a candidate environment:

1. Push the checked-in Supabase migrations to the target Supabase project.
2. Configure target Worker secrets/vars:
   - `ANALYTICS_PEPPER_V1`
   - `ANALYTICS_PEPPER_VERSION=v1`
   - `CHAT_CAPTURE_ENABLED=false`
   - `CHAT_CAPTURE_ARTIFACTS_ENABLED=true`
   - `CHAT_CAPTURE_MAX_INLINE_BYTES=64000`
3. Deploy the target Worker.
4. Flip `CHAT_CAPTURE_ENABLED=true`.
5. Run the capture smoke:

```bash
ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... \
node scripts/smoke/chat-capture-smoke.mjs \
  --target production \
  --exercise-orchestrate \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/smoke/chat-capture.json"
```

The smoke verifies the capture schema is reachable by service role, sends one
real `/chat/orchestrate` request with project context and a file, then confirms
thread/message/event/artifact/link rows were written for that conversation.

## Secret Crypto Compatibility Audit

Before rolling out the Wave 4 secret-crypto cleanup, generate a real report from
the target environment:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/secrets/audit-secret-crypto-compat.mjs \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/secret-crypto-audit.json"
```

If the report shows recoverable legacy rows, you can rewrite them into the
canonical per-record encrypted format in-place:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/secrets/audit-secret-crypto-compat.mjs \
  --apply-backfill \
  --write-json "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/audits/secret-crypto-audit.json"
```

Rows still reported as unreadable after the audit need manual rotation,
recreation, or deletion before closing Wave 4 secret cleanup, because runtime
decrypt paths now assume the canonical encrypted format only.

## Platform Alias Retirement Rollout

Before fully deleting the Wave 4 platform alias shim, use the staged runtime
switch first:

1. Review recent `platform_mcp_alias` logs and confirm the removable alias set
   is quiet enough to trial.
2. In staging, set `PLATFORM_MCP_DISABLED_ALIASES=removable`.
3. Deploy staging and run the normal smoke checks plus one legacy-alias probe
   from a known old client or a manual MCP call.
4. Confirm removable aliases now fail with a clear canonical replacement
   message, while blocked aliases like `ul.health`, `ul.gaps`,
   `ul.shortcomings`, `ul.markdown.list`, and `ul.markdown.share` still work.
5. Only after staging is clean should the same setting move to production.

## Backup And Restore Drill

Before closing the Wave 6 backup/restore item, run the real drill from:

- [docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md](BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md)

Initialize the drill packet inside the current evidence directory with:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/ops/init-backup-restore-drill.mjs \
  --source-environment production \
  --restore-target "<isolated-supabase-project-ref-or-name>" \
  --output-dir "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/restore-drill"
```

That creates the minimum drill artifact set:

- `restore-drill/metadata.json`
- `restore-drill/notes.md`
- `restore-drill/validation-queries.sql`

Use the drill document to record:

- the source restore reference
- the isolated restore target
- the validation seed rows
- actual RTO / RPO
- operator notes and surprises

Do not mark backup/restore as complete from documentation alone. The launch
scorecard should move only after a real restore has been executed and validated.

## Normal Release Flow

1. Merge release-ready work to `main`.
2. Wait for the `main` workflows to finish:
   - `API CI`
   - `Launch Guardrails`
   - `Supabase DB` staging deploy
   - `API Deploy` staging deploy
   - `Desktop Build`
   - `Staging Launch Gate`
3. Locally or in CI, confirm the Wave 1 guardrail baseline still matches:

   ```bash
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
   node scripts/checks/run-guardrail-checks.mjs
   ```

4. Run the staging smoke checks from
   [SMOKE_CHECKLISTS.md](SMOKE_CHECKLISTS.md).
   The current staging candidate SHA and its expected workflow links should now
   be visible in the `Staging Launch Gate` workflow summary and artifact. Keep
   `release-packet.md` open while you do this and fill the workflow, smoke,
   audit, and exception sections as evidence arrives.
   Prefer the wrapper:

   ```bash
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
   ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... node scripts/smoke/run-release-smoke.mjs \
     --target staging \
     --url https://staging-api.ultralight.dev \
     --supabase-url https://vonlzcnwxbwaxlbngjre.supabase.co \
     --exercise-chat
   ```
5. If staging fails, fix forward on `main`. Do not tag a known-bad commit.
6. Confirm the desktop version is correct in:
   - `desktop/package.json`
   - `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
   - `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
7. Create and push the release tag:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

8. Watch the tag-triggered production workflows:
   - `Supabase Production DB`
   - `API Deploy`
   - `Desktop Release`
   - `Production Launch Gate`
   Then initialize the production packet if it does not already exist:

   ```bash
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
   node scripts/ops/init-release-packet.mjs \
     --target production \
     --git-ref refs/tags/v0.1.0 \
     --version-tag v0.1.0 \
     --commit-sha <sha>
   ```
9. Run the production smoke checks from
   [SMOKE_CHECKLISTS.md](SMOKE_CHECKLISTS.md).
   Prefer the wrapper:

   ```bash
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
   ULTRALIGHT_TOKEN=... node scripts/smoke/run-release-smoke.mjs \
     --target production \
     --url https://api.ultralight.dev \
     --supabase-url https://uavjzycsltdnwblwutmb.supabase.co \
     --exercise-chat
   ```
   The production gate summary should reference the same candidate SHA that
   already passed `Staging Launch Gate`, plus the required production workflow
   run links for the release tag. Record those URLs and the resulting smoke
   summary in the release packet before announcement.
10. If you are validating the updater path, run the optional updater smoke with
   a previously tagged desktop build still installed.
11. Announce the release only after `Production Launch Gate` is green and
    production smoke passes, the release packet is complete, and the candidate
    satisfies
    [docs/LAUNCH_SIGNOFF_POLICY.md](LAUNCH_SIGNOFF_POLICY.md).

## Rollback Guidance

For the full rehearsal kit and scenario-specific playbooks, use:

- [docs/ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL.md](ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL.md)

Initialize the rehearsal packet with:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
node scripts/ops/init-rollback-rehearsal.mjs \
  --target production \
  --output-dir "$UL_LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_DIR/rollback-rehearsal"
```

That creates the minimum rehearsal artifacts:

- `rollback-rehearsal/metadata.json`
- `rollback-rehearsal/notes.md`

### If staging fails

- Do not tag.
- Fix forward on `main`.
- Re-run staging smoke after the fix lands.

### If a production workflow fails mid-release

- Fix forward with a new patch release.
- Do not move or reuse the existing tag.
- Cut a new tag such as `v0.1.1` from a revert or hotfix commit.

### Database caution

- Production database migrations should be additive and backward-compatible.
- This release flow does not assume automatic database rollback.
- If a migration causes a severe production issue, stop and treat it as a
  manual recovery event using Supabase restore / operator intervention.
- The backup-and-restore drill in
  [docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md](BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md)
  is the reference exercise for proving that this recovery path is actually
  usable.

### Desktop release issue after publication

- Prefer a hotfix patch release.
- If needed, point users to the previous signed GitHub Release artifact while
  the hotfix is prepared.
- Treat updater issues separately from installer issues in the incident notes.

## Operator Notes

- `main` builds staging desktop artifacts. Tags build production desktop
  releases.
- The release workflows are intentionally separate, so watch all production
  workflows on the tag before declaring success.
- `Launch Guardrails` is the CI backstop for tokenized-URL transport, wildcard
  CORS regressions, placeholder runtime strings, backup artifacts, and new
  root-level `migration-*.sql` files. Treat a failing guardrail workflow as
  stop-ship until reviewed. The current reviewed
  `query-token-auth` baseline is now `0`.
- The updater feed is GitHub Release `latest.json`, so production desktop
  updates depend on the repository staying public or on moving the updater feed
  elsewhere later.
- Desktop logout now calls the server sign-out path when a saved token is
  present, then clears secure local storage. This revokes the current
  Supabase session refresh path, but it is still not a global Google logout.
- Shared markdown links now bootstrap through
  `/share/p/:userId/:slug#share_token=...` and exchange that fragment secret
  into a page-scoped HttpOnly cookie before redirecting to the real page URL.
