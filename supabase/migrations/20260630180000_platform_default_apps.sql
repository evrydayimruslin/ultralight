-- Platform default-install registry: the id-keyed set of Agents that NEW
-- accounts are seeded with at first sign-in. Replaces the name-matched
-- DEFAULT_APP_NAMES constant in api/services/request-auth.ts, which silently
-- seeded fewer apps whenever a name was renamed/missing and could match the
-- wrong row when display names collided.
--
-- FORWARD-ONLY model: this table governs only what FUTURE signups receive.
-- provisionDefaultApps reads it at account creation and writes user_app_library
-- rows (source='default'). Adding/removing a row changes future seeding only —
-- it never writes to existing users' libraries (there is no broadcast/backfill
-- primitive anywhere). Updating an already-installed default for everyone who
-- has it is ordinary app versioning (the live KV bundle), not a row here.
--
-- This is PLATFORM POLICY, not user data: service_role only (RLS on, no policy
-- for the public PostgREST roles). The owner curates it via the private
-- "Defaults Manager" agent -> /api/admin/internal/defaults (owner-actor gated).
